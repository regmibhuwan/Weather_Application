# Python Weather Application
## Description
This Python script provides a simple simulation of a weather application. It allows users to input the name of a city and receive the current weather data for that location. The application covers a predefined list of cities (New York, London, Tokyo, Sydney) and generates random temperature values within specific ranges for each city, along with a fixed weather description.

## Features
- City Weather Lookup: Users can enter the name of one of the supported cities to get the current weather status, including temperature and general conditions.
- Randomized Temperature: The application generates a random temperature for a bit of variability, simulating different weather conditions each time it's run.

## Supported Cities
- New York
- London
- Tokyo
- Sydney
